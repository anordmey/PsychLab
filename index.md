# Demos and Tutorials for Stats for Psych Students

These tutorials will guide students through several demonstrations of Psychology concepts and classic experiments, as well as providing students with tutorials to practice analyzing data and interpreting statistics. 

Each tutorial contains a demonstration of a Psychology study, a file containing data from other students who have participated in this demo, and one or more "mini-projects" to practice analyzing the data from the demonstration. 

The tutorials below use the open-source software jamovi, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.jamovi.org/). 

For additional resources, I recommend the textbook [learning statistics with jamovi](https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/).

## Descriptive Statistics

These three mini-projects guide you through how to create variables, analyze descriptive statistics, and create graphs in jamovi. You should complete these mini-projects in order, as each one builds on the previous project. 

**Demo: Math Anxiety Questionnaire**

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4bVkjJ04hxI0nHT4YpU6fGiviqJFllM32IiJ2NwMaCJz7Ow/viewform) to take a survey exploring the relationship between students' math anxiety and their previous experience with math courses. 

**Data: Math Anxiety Data**

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CdoJmczYUtTuhUBgK1MRoLQwGqtKudhSN9xs5RuTXMk/edit?usp=sharing) to download the data from past students and participants who have taken the Math Anxieyt Questionnaire. You will need to save these data and open them in jamovi to complete the "mini-projects" below. Download this file to your computer to analyze in jamovi. 

To open data in jamovi: 

- First click the three lines in the upper left-hand corner of jamovi. 

- Click “open”, then click “browse” to find the Math Anxiety csv file wherever you saved it on your computer. 

**Mini-Project: Creating variables**

In this mini-project you will practice setting the correct “scale of measurement” for each of your variables, and learn how to recode variables and create new variables.

**Mini-Project: Descriptive statistics**

In this mini-project, you will learn how to calculate descriptive statistics in jamovi.

## t-tests

These demos and mini-projects will guide you through how to conduct two types of t-test: the independent samples t-test, and the paired samples t-test. 

**Demo: Deep Processing**

A classic Cognitive Psychology paper, Hyde & Jenkins (1969), showed that people remember more if they associate the things they are memorizing with meaningful information (for example, whether a word is pleasant or not pleasant) vs. incidental (for example, whether the word has an E in it). 

This demo is set up as a "between subjects" design, meaning that every participant would be randomly assigned to participate in one condition or the other. To understand the task, you can view both conditions here:

**Demo: Visual Imagery** 

A classic Cognitive Psychology paper, Paivio, Smythe, & Yuille (1968), showed that people find it easier to remember high-imagery words (i.e. concrete words that are easy to create a picture of in your mind) compared to low-imagery words (i.e. abstract words that are difficult to visualize).

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

**Demo: Stroop Demo**

The purpose of the Stroop task is to measure “cognitive interference” – the challenge of paying attention to one stimulus while ignoring another. In the classic Stroop task, participants are shown a list of color words printed in mismatching colors (i.e. the word blue printed in red ink). Because reading is an automatic process for literate adults, most people find it difficult to not say the word, even if they are asked to ignore the printed word and just name the color. As a control task, you can show people words printed in matching colors (i.e. the word blue printed in blue ink) or leave out words entirely (i.e. xxxxx). In all versions of the task, participants are asked to say out loud the name of the color they see, and the speed that it takes participants to name the colors is compared across conditions.

## Correlation

**Demo: Anxiety and Social Media**
Several researchers have noted an increase in anxiety disorders, particularly amongst teenagers and college students. Some authors have speculated that this might be related to rising social media use. This demo explores this link.
